# Narcity technical test

This is a technical test project to demonstrate a simple web application consuming data from a public API.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/magnav56/narcity.git
cd narcity
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, and watches for changes to the source files.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Notes

I had to use a chrome extension named Moesif Origin & CORS Changer in order to call the public API.
