# Narcity technical test

This is a technical test project to demonstrate a simple web application consuming data from a public API.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/magnav56/narcity.git
cd narcity
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Notes

I had to use a chrome extension named Moesif Origin & CORS Changer in order to call the public API.
